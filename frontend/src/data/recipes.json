  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Line a very large sheet pan (I use this 15x21 inch sheet pan) or 2 smaller pans with parchment paper and set aside.",
    "It is important to prep the veggies according to directions to ensure they all cook at the same rate. Wash and chop the unpeeled baby red potatoes. You want the pieces quite small. I halve the baby potatoes and then dice each half. This yields a total of 10-12 pieces per potato. Trim the green beans and then cut in half, chop the broccoli into florets, chop the peppers into 1-inch pieces, and coin the sausage in thick (1/2-inch) slices.",
    "Place all the veggies and sausage on the prepared sheet pan. Pour the olive oil and all the seasonings on top. Season to taste with salt and pepper (I add 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper to start with). Use your hands to toss and evenly coat all the veggies and sausage with seasonings. Space everything out so it has plenty of space to cook. If veggies are crammed/overlapping they'll steam instead of roast and will take longer to cook.",
    "Bake 15 minutes, remove from the oven and flip/stir all the veggies around. Return to the oven and bake for another 10-15 minutes or until vegetables are crisp-tender."
